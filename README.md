Regulations Parser
==================

This library/tool parses federal regulations (either plain text or XML) and
much of their associated content. It can write the results to JSON files, an
API, or even a git repository. The parser works hand-in-hand with
regulations-core, an API for hosting the parsed regulations and
regulation-site, a front-end for the data structures generated.

This repository is part of a larger project. To read about it, please see
