    "abstract": "The Commission published technical amendments to its regulations on December 26, 2002, entitled ``BCRA Technical Amendments.'' These amendments became effective upon publication. However, some of the amendments changed regulations that were promulgated but had not become effective as of December 26, 2002, and therefore could not take effect. Thus, the Commission is re- promulgating the technical amendments that did not take effect with the original BRCA technical amendments. Further information is provided in the supplementary information that follows.",
