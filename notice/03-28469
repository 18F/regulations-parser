    "abstract": "The Federal Election Commission is revising its rules covering four areas: (1) Multicandidate political committee status, (2) annual contributions by persons other than multicandidate committees to national party committees, (3) contributions to candidates for more than one Federal office; and (4) biennial contribution limits for individuals. These final rules provide that once a political committee satisfies certain criteria, it automatically becomes a multicandidate committee and is required to notify the Commission of its new status. The final rules also update the limit on contributions from persons other than multicandidate committees to national party committees and to candidates running for more than one Federal office. In addition, the final rules adjust the attribution of contributions to candidates from individuals under the biennial limits. Further information is provided in the supplementary information that follows.",
