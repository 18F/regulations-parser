    "abstract": "The Federal Election Commission (``FEC'' or ``Commission'') is adopting, as interim final rules, new regulations relating to increased contribution limits for individuals when contributing to candidates who are facing self-financed candidates under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (``FECA'' or the ``Act''), as amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (``BCRA''). The so-called ``Millionaires' Amendment'' in BCRA raises the individual contribution limits for candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives depending on the amount that opposing candidates expend from personal funds in connection with an election. BCRA also removes the limitations on national and State party committee expenditures on behalf of a candidate if the opposing candidate's expenditures from personal funds exceed a threshold amount. These interim final rules implement the various provisions of the Millionaires' Amendment including thresholds, computation formulas, increased contribution limits with overall caps, repayment of personal loans, and reporting requirements. The Commission is promulgating these rules on an interim final basis. The Commission is soliciting comments on all aspects of the interim final rules and may amend the interim rules as appropriate in response to comments received. Further information is contained in the Supplementary Information that follows.", 
    "action": "Interim final rules.",
