    "abstract": "The Federal Election Commission is issuing final rules regarding payments for communications that are coordinated with a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or a political party committee. The final rules also address expenditures by political party committees that are made either in coordination with, or independently from, candidates. These final rules implement several requirements in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (``BCRA'') that significantly amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (``FECA'' or the ``Act''). Further information is contained in the Supplementary Information that follows.",
