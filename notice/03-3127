    "abstract": "The Federal Election Commission published final rules on January 3, 2003, regarding payments for communications that are coordinated with a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or a political party committee. The final rules also addressed expenditures by political party committees that are made either in coordination with, or independently from, candidate. The final rules implemented several requirements of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (``BCRA''). Two amendatory instructions were incorrect. This document corrects the amendatory instructions. There is no substantive change to the final rules.",
