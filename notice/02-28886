    "abstract": "The Federal Election Commission is issuing these final rules to implement amendments made by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (``BCRA'') to the contribution limitations and prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (``FECA'' or ``the Act''). These rules increase the limits on contributions made by individuals and political committees; index certain contribution limits for inflation; prohibit contributions by minors to candidates, authorized committees and committees of political parties and donations by minors to committees of political parties; and prohibit contributions, donations, expenditures, independent expenditures and disbursements by foreign nationals. These rules also revise the Commission's rules for designating contributions to particular elections and attributing contributions to particular donors. Further information is provided in the Supplementary Information that follows.",
