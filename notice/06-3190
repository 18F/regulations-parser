    "abstract": "The Federal Election Commission is amending its rules to include paid advertisements on the Internet in the definition of ``public communication.'' These final rules implement the recent decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in Shays v. Federal Election Commission, which held that the previous definition of ``public communication'' impermissibly excluded all Internet communications. The revised definition of ``public communication'' includes paid Internet advertising placed on another person's website, but does not encompass any other form of Internet communication. The Commission is also re-promulgating without change its definition of ``generic campaign activity'' and amending the scope of its disclaimer regulations, both of which incorporate the revised definition of ``public communication.'' Additionally, the Commission is adding new exceptions to the definitions of ``contribution'' and ``expenditure'' to exclude Internet activities and communications that qualify as individual activity or that qualify for the ``media exemption.'' These final rules are intended to ensure that political committees properly finance and disclose their Internet communications, without impeding individual citizens from using the Internet to speak freely regarding candidates and elections. Further information is provided in the Supplementary Information that follows.",
