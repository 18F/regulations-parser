    "abstract": "The Federal Election Commission is revising its rules relating to funds raised, received, and spent by party committees under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (``FECA'' or the ``Act''). The revisions are based on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (``BCRA''), which adds to the Act new restrictions and prohibitions on the receipt, solicitation, and use of certain types of non-Federal funds, which are commonly referred to as ``soft money.'' BCRA and the revised rules prohibit national parties from raising or spending non-Federal funds. They also permit State, district, and local party committees to fund certain ``Federal election activity,'' including certain voter registration and get-out-the-vote (``GOTV'') drives, with money raised pursuant to new limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements under BCRA, or with a combination of funds subject to various requirements of the Act and BCRA. They also address fundraising by Federal and non-Federal candidates and Federal officeholders on behalf of political party committees, other candidates, and non-profit organizations. Further information is contained in the Supplementary Information that follows.",
